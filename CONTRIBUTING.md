# Contributing

Thanks for helping with the Otto DIY robot project.

## Workflow
- Open an issue or start a discussion before large changes.
- Create a feature branch off `main`.
- Keep commits focused and message clearly.

## Code
- Prefer small, testable changes.
- Keep `src/` for PlatformIO, `arduino/` for Arduino IDE.

## Hardware
- Add drawings, photos, and part notes to `hardware/`.
- Document measurements and sources in `docs/`.

## Testing
- Verify builds locally for the target board before opening a PR.
